            "Minesweeper" was a game that was created back in 1989 and it was one that 
            we both enjoy playing in our pastime.
            We were inspired to create a website that we ourselves would love to 
            use every day, so we decided to implement our own rendition of "Minesweeper". Overall, 
            this was a great learning experience for the both of us due to how much knowledge 
            we have gained about HTML, CSS, JS and React especially since this was our first
            time working with the React framework. This project took us around 2-3 months to build 
            due to needing to learn a few things prior to creating this finished product. There 
            is definitely more we can improve on the site, but we felt it was best to leave it where it
            is so we can pursue different projects in the future.

          This was the first instance of us working with AI after learning about the theory 
          behind how some of these algorithms work. For the learning environment 
          we used a game called "Snake" which was created in 1997 where the user would 
          control a snake and eat as many red squares on the board before running into either a wall
          or itself. We utilized packages such as 
          PyTorch and NumPy in order to present our first visual representation of the 
          power AI and Reinforcement Learning hold. This was thanks to a tutorial from 
          FreeCodeCamp since we had no experience with these packages before this project.
          We always felt inspired to work with machine learning models and completing this 
          one in particular was somewhat grueling, but was ultimately worth it in the very end.
          The "Snake" game was borrowed from the person who hosted the tutorial and everything 
          ran under the Python programming language. This was only a one day endeavor since this was 
          just a glimpse into what potential AI really has in store for us.

          After completing the Snake Game AI project, we felt inspired to continue further 
          into a different type of development that involved Unity as the environment.
          This time, the AI agent would interact with the blue cube that is seen
          bouncing all over the screens above and its job is to jump around reaching the goal as many times
          as they can before they fall off the map. This was our first Unity project together and we used
          the ml-agents package for the reinforcement learning aspect of this new environment.
          This was developed using C# as the main programming language. This project took 
          about a week to complete since we were working on this on our own without a project 
          guided tutorial to fall back on. This meant we had to get a grasp of the ml-agents package to 
          really complete the final product which did take some time.
