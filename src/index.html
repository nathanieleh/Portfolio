          It was an exciting project for us due to the both of us enjoying Minesweeper 
          very much. We were inspired to create a website that we ourselves would love to 
          use every day and we think we were somewhat successful at doing so. Overall, 
          this was a great learning experience for the both of us due to how much knowledge 
          we have gained about HTML, CSS, JS and React especially since this was our first
          time working with the React framework.

        This was the first instance of us working with AI utilizing packages such as 
        PyTorch and numpy in order to present our first visual representation of the 
        power AI and Deep Learning holds. This was thanks to a tutorial from 
        FreeCodeCamp since we had no experience with these packages before this project.
        We always felt inspired to work with machine learning models and completing this 
        one in particular was somewhat grueling, but was ultimately worth it in the very end.
        The Snake Game was borrowed from the person who hosted the tutorial and everything 
        ran under the Python programming language.

        After completing the Snake Game AI, we felt inspired to continue further 
        into a different type of development that involved Unity as the environment.
        This time, the user would interact with the cube and reach the goal as many times
        before they fall off the map. This was our first Unity project together and we used
        the ml-agents package for the reinforcement learning aspect of this new environment.
        This was developed using C# as the main programming language.
