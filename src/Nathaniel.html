      Scuffdle is a game that is based off of the very popular web game WORDLE where the goal is to 
      guess a hidden five letter word in 6 tries. 
      This was my very first web development project I did that became really involved with javascript.
      A large start to this project was done with the help of a tutorial made by CoderCoder 
      where she helped with the basic functionality of the game itself and the aesthetic of the game. 
      A majority of my own programming went into the javascript file in order to complete a fully
      functioning game. Not only was this a first with javascript, but this was also a first for working
      independently from a tutorial once the framework of the game was complete which really challenged 
      my skills that I have gained thus far in web development.

      This was my FIRST web project in which I followed a tutorial step by step by CoderCoder.
      The entire point of this project was to get familiar with all of the different types of 
      programming skills I will need to become independent as a web developer. The website itself
      is purely for design, there is no significance to it other than the aesthetic. Figma was a 
      very big part of the process since the design was borrowed by another user, so the job was
      to recreate the figma designs onto an actual webpage.
